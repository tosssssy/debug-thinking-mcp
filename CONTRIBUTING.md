## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-server-debug-thinking.git
   cd mcp-server-debug-thinking
   ```

- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write self-documenting code when possible

### Code Validation

- Test your changes with Claude Desktop

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Commit Messages
