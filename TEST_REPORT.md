# Test Coverage Report

This document summarizes the test coverage for the debug-thinking-mcp project.

## Test Files Created

### 1. **Unit Tests**

#### Types (`src/__tests__/types/`)
- **graph.test.ts**: Tests for graph type definitions and type guards
  - Node type guards (isProblemNode, isHypothesisNode, etc.)
  - Edge types and structure
  - Node metadata handling
  - DebugGraph structure

- **graphActions.test.ts**: Tests for action types and helper functions
  - ActionType enum validation
  - CreateAction, ConnectAction, QueryAction structures
  - Response type structures
  - getAutoEdgeType helper function

#### Services (`src/__tests__/services/`)
- **GraphService.test.ts**: Comprehensive tests for the main GraphService
  - CREATE action: node creation with automatic edge generation
  - CONNECT action: manual edge creation with conflict detection
  - QUERY action: various query types (similar-problems, node-details, etc.)
  - Graph persistence and loading
  - Edge type validation

- **GraphStorage.test.ts**: Tests for persistence layer
  - Directory initialization
  - Node and edge saving to JSONL format
  - Graph metadata persistence
  - Loading and deduplication logic
  - Error handling for file operations

#### Utilities (`src/__tests__/utils/`)
- **format.test.ts**: Tests for response formatting
  - MCP response structure creation
  - JSON formatting with proper indentation
  - Error response handling
  - Edge cases (null, undefined, circular references)

- **storage.test.ts**: Tests for file system utilities
  - Directory creation and verification
  - JSON file writing and reading
  - JSONL append and streaming operations
  - File existence checks
  - Error handling

### 2. **Integration Tests**
- **index.test.ts**: Basic tests for the MCP server setup
  - Tool name and configuration verification
  - Environment checks
  - File structure validation

### 3. **Test Configuration**
- **vitest.config.ts**: Vitest configuration with proper module resolution
- **setup.ts**: Test setup with mocks and environment configuration
- **package.json**: Updated with test scripts and Vitest dependencies

## Test Results

All 82 tests pass successfully:
- ✓ 7 test files
- ✓ 82 tests total
- 0 failures

## Coverage Areas

1. **Graph Operations**
   - Node creation with all types (problem, hypothesis, experiment, observation, learning, solution)
   - Automatic edge creation based on parent-child relationships
   - Manual edge creation with relationship types
   - Conflict detection for contradicting edges

2. **Query Functionality**
   - Similar problem search
   - Node detail retrieval
   - Learning path tracing
   - Graph visualization
   - Pattern matching

3. **Data Persistence**
   - JSONL format for nodes and edges
   - JSON format for metadata
   - Deduplication on load
   - File system error handling

4. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive type guard tests
   - Action type validation
   - Response structure verification

## Test Isolation

Tests are properly isolated with:
- Unique test directories per test run
- Environment variable cleanup
- Mock restoration after each test
- No shared state between tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/GraphService.test.ts
```
